# 🔢🧵 Operations with Arrays and Strings Programs in C++

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* 💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* 🌐 Online GDB Compiler / any standard C++ compiler

## 📚 Theory

This experiment covers essential operations on **arrays** and **strings** in C++. Arrays store multiple values of the same type, while strings handle sequences of characters. These structures are fundamental for building logic in real-world applications.

## 📐 Algorithms

### 1️⃣ Printing Array Elements

🔸 Define an array with values
🔸 Loop through the array using a `for` loop
🔸 Print each element

### 2️⃣ Find a Number in an Array

🔍 Take number input
🔸 Loop through array
✅ If found, display result

### 3️⃣ Sum and Average of Array Elements

➕ Initialize `sum = 0` 
🔁 Add each element to sum 
➗ Calculate average = sum / count 

### 4️⃣ Find Minimum and Maximum

📉 Initialize `min`, `max` as first element 
🔁 Compare each element 
📈 Update `min` and `max` if needed 

### 5️⃣ String Declaration & Initialization

📝 Use character arrays 
📦 Use C++ `string` class 

### 6️⃣ String Concatenation

🔗 Declare two strings
➕ Combine using `+` operator

### 7️⃣ Reverse a String

↩️ Take input string
🔁 Loop from end to start
🖨️ Print in reverse

### 8️⃣ Palindrome Check

🔄 Reverse string
🔍 Compare with original
✅ If equal, it's a palindrome

## ✅ Conclusion

This experiment strengthened understanding of core C++ operations on arrays and strings. 💡 It improved logic-building skills, enhanced familiarity with loops, conditionals, and string handling—building a solid foundation for future programming challenges. 🚀
