# Operations with Arrays and Strings Programs in C++

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Online GDB Compiler / any standard C++ compiler

## Theory

This experiment introduces basic and essential operations with arrays and strings in C++. Arrays allow storage of multiple data values of the same type, while strings handle character sequences. Mastery over these data structures is crucial for efficient programming.

### Algorithms

#### 1. Printing Array Elements
- Define an array with values
- Loop through the array using a `for` loop
- Print each element

#### 2. To Find a Number in a Given Array
- Define array and take a number input
- Traverse array using loop
- If match found, print found message

#### 3. Sum and Average of Array Elements
- Initialize sum = 0
- Traverse and add each element to sum
- Calculate average = sum / number of elements

#### 4. To Find Minimum and Maximum Number
- Initialize `min` and `max` as first element
- Loop through array
- Update `min` and `max` accordingly

#### 5. Different Ways to Declare and Initialize a String
- Use character arrays
- Use C++ string class (e.g., `std::string`)

#### 6. Concatenation of Strings
- Declare two strings
- Use `+` operator to concatenate

#### 7. Printing String in Reverse
- Take input string
- Use reverse loop to print characters from end to start

#### 8. Palindrome Checking
- Take input string
- Reverse the string and compare with original

## Conclusion

This experiment helped in understanding basic array and string operations in C++, which form the foundation of data manipulation and storage. It also improved logic-building skills and familiarized us with common algorithmic approaches in programming. Through hands-on coding, our understanding of looping, conditionals, and string methods has been enhanced significantly.
